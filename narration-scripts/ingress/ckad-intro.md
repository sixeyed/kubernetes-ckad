Excellent work on the hands-on exercises! You've now practiced installing Ingress controllers, creating Ingress resources with host and path-based routing, configuring response caching, and working through the lab challenges. Here's what you need to know for CKAD: Ingress is guaranteed exam content, it's supplementary material that's extremely helpful and may appear on the exam. You'll be expected to create Ingress resources with routing rules, potentially configure TLS, and troubleshoot when routing doesn't work. The exam expects you to know Ingress syntax and common patterns without needing to look them up constantly.

That's what we're going to focus on in this CKAD-specific section: exam-ready Ingress scenarios and rapid creation techniques that will help you handle any Ingress question efficiently.

Let's start by understanding the CKAD Ingress requirements specifically. The exam documentation outlines what you need to know, and this section covers all of it systematically. You'll need to be comfortable with the API specs for the networking.k8s.io/v1 Ingress resource, which has a specific structure that you need to get exactly right. Understanding the Ingress architecture review is critical because you need to know how Ingress controllers, Ingress resources, and backend Services work together as a system.

One of the most testable areas is path types, and this is where candidates often make mistakes. You need to understand the difference between Prefix, Exact, and ImplementationSpecific path types, when to use each one, and how they affect routing behavior. The exam might specify which path type to use, or you might need to choose the appropriate one based on the requirements given.

Host-based routing is fundamental, and you'll need to configure Ingress rules that route traffic based on the hostname in the HTTP request. This includes understanding how to set up routing for a single host, multiple hosts with different backends, and even wildcard hosts if your controller supports them. Path-based routing builds on this by adding URL path matching, so you can route requests to different Services based on both the hostname and the path. Combining host and path routing is where things get sophisticated, and you'll see exam scenarios that require complex routing patterns using both dimensions.

The concept of IngressClass is important for environments with multiple Ingress controllers. You need to know how to specify which controller should handle a particular Ingress resource, how to set a default IngressClass, and what happens when you don't specify one. TLS and HTTPS configuration is another likely exam topic, covering how to create TLS Secrets, reference them in Ingress resources, configure certificate validation, and handle HTTP to HTTPS redirects.

Understanding the default backend concept helps you handle requests that don't match any routing rules. You'll configure fallback Services that provide a better user experience than the raw 404 from the controller. Annotations are how you access controller-specific features, and while you won't need to memorize every possible annotation, you should know common ones like rewrite-target, CORS configuration, SSL redirect, and rate limiting that appear frequently in real deployments.

Cross-namespace considerations are crucial because Ingress resources can only reference Services in the same namespace. You'll need to understand this limitation, know how to work around it with multiple Ingress resources, and be aware of the ExternalName Service pattern for advanced scenarios. Troubleshooting Ingress issues is a practical skill you'll need both on the exam and in real work. This means checking Ingress status, verifying backend Services exist and have endpoints, examining controller logs, and systematically debugging common problems.

Port references might seem like a small detail, but knowing that you can reference Service ports by either number or name can make your Ingress configurations more maintainable and flexible. The CKAD exam tips section gives you speed commands and shortcuts, like using kubectl create ingress with rule flags for simple scenarios, or knowing when to fall back to YAML for complex routing requirements.

You'll also work through a comprehensive lab challenge that simulates a complete multi-service application deployment. This brings together all the Ingress concepts into a realistic scenario with multiple routing rules, TLS configuration, annotations, and troubleshooting requirements. The quick reference card provides syntax patterns you can memorize for rapid recall during the exam.

Beyond the core learning, you'll want to review the cleanup procedures so you know how to remove Ingress resources, controllers, and related objects cleanly. The further reading section points you to official Kubernetes documentation, controller-specific guides, and advanced topics like cert-manager for automated certificate management.

The CKAD exam tests practical Ingress configuration under time pressure. You'll see requirements like "route traffic for app.example.com to the web service on port 80" or "configure path-based routing for /app and /api to different backends." You need to translate these into correct Ingress YAML quickly and accurately. For simple cases, using kubectl create ingress with the rule flag syntax can save time, but for complex routing patterns with multiple hosts and paths, writing YAML directly is often faster once you've memorized the structure.

The backend Service configuration syntax changed in networking.k8s.io/v1, so you need to know the current format with backend.service.name and backend.service.port.number or backend.service.port.name. Getting these details wrong means your Ingress won't route traffic, and you'll lose valuable time debugging. The pathType field is required in the current API version, you can't omit it like in older versions.

Practice Ingress creation until the YAML structure is muscle memory. When you see "route app.example.com to service web on port 80," you should immediately visualize the correct YAML with the rules, host, http, paths, path, pathType, and backend fields in the right structure. Time yourself creating various Ingress configurations to build speed and confidence.

Remember that troubleshooting is just as important as creation. If you create an Ingress and it's not working, you need a systematic approach: check that the Ingress was created successfully, verify the backend Service exists in the same namespace, check that the Service has endpoints which means it has ready Pods behind it, examine the Ingress controller logs for errors, and verify your path matching and pathType settings.

Let's dive into CKAD-specific Ingress scenarios and build the skills you need to handle any Ingress question on the exam efficiently and confidently!
