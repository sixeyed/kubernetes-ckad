Welcome back! Now that we've covered the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes Operators, it's time to see them in action. In this hands-on exercises video, we're going to explore how operators extend Kubernetes to manage complex applications with their own operational knowledge.

Before we dive into the exercises, it's worth noting that operators represent advanced material that goes beyond the core CKAD certification requirements. However, they're increasingly common in production environments, so understanding how they work provides valuable context for real-world Kubernetes deployments. While you won't need to implement operators for the CKAD exam, recognizing when you're working with operator-managed resources will help you understand and troubleshoot modern Kubernetes applications.

We'll start by exploring custom resources, which form the foundation of how operators extend the Kubernetes API. You'll learn how to define new resource types using CustomResourceDefinitions, or CRDs, and then create instances of those custom resources in your cluster. This gives you a firsthand look at how Kubernetes can be extended beyond its built-in resource types to support domain-specific applications and operational patterns.

Next, we'll work with the NATS Operator, which manages high-performance message queues for distributed applications. You'll install the operator, see how it registers its own custom resource types with the cluster, and then deploy a clustered message queue by creating a simple custom resource. This demonstrates the real power of operators - instead of manually deploying and configuring multiple pods, services, and other components, you'll describe what you want at a high level and let the operator handle all the implementation details.

We'll then move on to the MySql Operator, which showcases how operators can manage complex stateful applications. You'll see how the operator handles database clustering, replication, backups, and all the operational complexity that would typically require extensive manual configuration and ongoing maintenance. The operator encapsulates that operational knowledge and makes it available through simple declarative resources.

Throughout the exercises, you'll observe how operators use controllers to watch for custom resources and reconcile them into actual Kubernetes deployments, services, and other objects. You'll see the reference documentation for both operators, understand how they extend your cluster's capabilities, and learn how to interact with the custom resources they provide using standard kubectl commands.

Finally, we'll bring everything together in a lab exercise where you'll use both operators to deploy infrastructure components for a real application. You'll create the message queue and database clusters that the application needs, seeing how operators make complex infrastructure as simple to deploy as any other Kubernetes resource. The lab also covers proper cleanup procedures, which is particularly important with operators since you need to delete custom resources before removing the CRDs and operators themselves.

Before starting, make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster with admin permissions, since operators typically require elevated privileges to install custom resource definitions and manage resources across your cluster. You'll also need kubectl configured and ready to go, along with your terminal and text editor. Keep in mind that some operators have platform-specific requirements - the examples we're using don't support ARM64 processors, so if you're on Apple Silicon, some exercises may not work fully.

The exercises use straightforward, educational operators that demonstrate core concepts without the complexity you'd find in production-grade operators. This helps you focus on understanding the operator pattern itself rather than getting lost in implementation details. Let's get started and see how operators bring automation and operational knowledge directly into your Kubernetes clusters!
