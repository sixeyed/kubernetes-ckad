Welcome back! Now that we've covered the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes Services, what they are, why they're essential for networking, and the different Service types, it's time to see them in action through hands-on practice.

In the upcoming exercises video, we're going to work through the complete Services lab, starting with the API specs section where we'll examine the Service resource definition and understand the relationship between Services and Pod YAML. You'll see how labels in Pod metadata connect to Service selectors, which is the foundation of how Kubernetes routes traffic dynamically.

We'll begin by running sample Pods, creating simple Pod definitions with labels that we can target with Services. This gives us the foundation to explore how Services discover and route to Pods. Then we'll deploy an internal Service, creating a ClusterIP Service that exposes our application within the cluster. You'll see how the Service gets a stable IP address and becomes part of the cluster's DNS system. This leads us into the section on using DNS to find the Service, where you'll test connectivity from other Pods using both Service IPs and DNS names. You'll understand how Kubernetes makes service discovery automatic, and you'll see what happens when Pods are replaced and get new IP addresses while the Service IP remains constant.

Next, we'll move into understanding external Services, exploring the differences between LoadBalancer and NodePort Service types. You'll learn why some clusters support LoadBalancers while others require NodePorts, and you'll understand the tradeoffs between these approaches. Then we'll deploy an external Service, actually creating both NodePort and LoadBalancer Services so you can access the application from outside the cluster. You'll see how these external Service types also create ClusterIP addresses for internal access, giving you flexibility in how applications communicate.

The exercises culminate in a Lab challenge where you'll apply everything you've learned. You'll work with scenarios involving zero Pod matches for label selectors and multiple Pods matching the same selector. You'll discover how to verify whether a Service has found matching Pods and what happens when the selector doesn't match any running Pods. This hands-on problem solving reinforces the core concepts and prepares you for real troubleshooting situations. Finally, there's a Cleanup section showing you how to efficiently remove all the resources using label selectors.

Before starting the exercises video, make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster. Any distribution works, whether it's Docker Desktop, k3s, kind, or a cloud provider. You'll need kubectl installed and configured to communicate with your cluster. Have a terminal and text editor ready, and ensure you can access Services through port-forward, NodePort, or LoadBalancer depending on your environment's capabilities. The exercises use simple web applications that make it easy to verify connectivity and see which Pod is responding to requests.

This matters tremendously for the CKAD exam because Services are core exam content. You'll absolutely be asked to create Services, expose Deployments, and troubleshoot networking issues. The exam expects you to understand all Service types and know when to use each one. You need to be comfortable creating Services quickly and verifying they're working correctly. Beyond the exam, Services are fundamental to Kubernetes networking. Every application that needs to be accessed, whether by other Pods or external users, needs a Service. Understanding how Services work, how they use label selectors to find Pods, how DNS integration provides service discovery, and how different Service types enable internal and external access is essential for building reliable distributed applications in Kubernetes.

Let's get started with the hands-on exercises and see Services in action!
