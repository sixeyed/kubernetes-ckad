Welcome back! Now that we've covered the fundamental concepts of Jobs and CronJobs, what they are, how they differ from Deployments, and when to use them for batch workloads, it's time to see them in action. In the upcoming exercises video, we're going to create Jobs for one-time tasks and CronJobs for scheduled workloads. You'll see how Kubernetes manages job completion, handles failures, and implements parallelism.

In the hands-on exercises, we'll start by understanding the API specs for Jobs and CronJobs. These are part of the batch API group, and they follow the familiar Kubernetes pattern of having a spec with a template that contains a Pod spec. The key difference is that Jobs expect their Pods to terminate successfully rather than run continuously. We'll explore Job patterns and CronJob scheduling through practical examples that make the behavior visible and easy to understand.

First, you'll run a one-off task in a Job and watch it execute to completion. You'll see how Jobs create Pods that run once and terminate, unlike Deployments where Pods run continuously. You'll understand the job lifecycle, how to check completion status, and how Jobs apply labels to their Pods for easy tracking. We'll look at how Jobs remain in the cluster after completion so you can inspect logs and understand what happened, which is different from having to immediately clean up resources.

Then, we'll work with running a Job with multiple concurrent tasks. You'll create Jobs with multiple completions, Jobs that run Pods in parallel, and Jobs that combine both patterns to process fixed sets of work. You'll see how Kubernetes manages these complex execution patterns automatically, spinning up the right number of Pods to meet your parallelism requirements while working toward the total number of completions you've specified. This is particularly useful when you have a batch of work items that can be processed independently.

Next, you'll explore scheduling tasks with CronJobs. You'll create CronJobs using cron syntax to define when Jobs should be created, and you'll see them trigger job executions on schedule. We'll look at patterns like backups, reports, and maintenance tasks that run periodically. You'll understand how CronJobs wrap Job specifications and add scheduling capabilities, and how the concurrency policy controls what happens when a scheduled Job is due but the previous one is still running.

The lab exercise will challenge you to work with CronJob suspension and triggering manual Jobs from CronJob specs without using kubectl apply. This is a common pattern when you want to test a scheduled job immediately or when you need to run an extra execution outside the normal schedule. You'll learn how to suspend a CronJob to prevent it from creating new Jobs during maintenance windows, and then resume it afterward.

We'll also cover an extra section on managing failures in Jobs. You'll see how different restart policies affect Job behavior, whether Pods restart in place or new Pods are created when containers fail. You'll work with backoff limits to control how many times Kubernetes retries failed Pods before marking the Job as failed, and you'll understand the exponential backoff that prevents rapid retry loops from overwhelming your cluster.

Before starting the exercises video, make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster, any distribution works, kubectl installed and configured, and a terminal and text editor ready. Understanding of cron syntax basics is helpful but not required, as we'll explain the patterns as we use them. The exercises use simple container commands that make Job behavior visible and easy to understand. You can follow along on your own cluster, or watch first and practice afterward.

Jobs and CronJobs are core CKAD exam content. You'll be asked to create Jobs for one-time tasks and CronJobs for scheduled workloads. The exam expects you to understand completion semantics, parallelism, and schedule syntax. Beyond the exam, Jobs and CronJobs are essential for batch processing, database migrations, backups, scheduled reports, and any task that runs to completion rather than continuously.

Let's get started with the hands-on exercises!
