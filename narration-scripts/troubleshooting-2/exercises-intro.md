Welcome back! Now that we've covered the fundamentals of troubleshooting individual Kubernetes resources, it's time to tackle something more realistic and more challenging. Real applications in Kubernetes rarely consist of just a single Pod or Deployment. Instead, they're composed of multiple interconnected resources that all need to work together harmoniously. This is what we call application modeling, and when something goes wrong, troubleshooting becomes significantly more interesting.

In this lab, we're going to work with a web application that represents a typical Kubernetes deployment. This app reads its configuration from a ConfigMap, stores sensitive database credentials in a Secret, persists data using a PersistentVolume, and runs in its own custom namespace. Each of these resources serves a specific purpose, and each one needs to be configured correctly for the application to work. When you deploy real applications to Kubernetes, you'll almost always use this same pattern of multiple resources working together.

The challenge here is that something is wrong with this deployment. Actually, several things are wrong. When you apply the specs and try to run this app, it won't work. Your goal is to diagnose the problems systematically and fix them until you can successfully browse to the application and see it displaying its configuration. This requires thinking about how all these different resources interact with each other, understanding the relationships between namespaces, volumes, and configuration data, and methodically tracking down each issue.

What makes this type of troubleshooting different from what we've done before is that the problems can cascade. A misconfigured namespace means your ConfigMap might not be accessible. A problem with your Secret format means your Pod can't start. A StorageClass that doesn't exist means your PersistentVolumeClaim can't bind, which keeps your Pod in a pending state. Each issue needs to be identified and resolved before you can move on to discover the next one. This is exactly how troubleshooting works in production environments, where one configuration error can mask or trigger other problems.

Before you start the hands-on exercises, make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and kubectl properly configured. You'll need a terminal and text editor ready, and you should be comfortable with the basic troubleshooting commands we covered earlier. The key to success here is being systematic. Don't just guess at fixes or randomly edit YAML files. Instead, use describe commands to understand what's happening, check logs when Pods fail, verify that resources exist in the namespaces where they're expected, and work through each issue methodically.

The lab provides hints if you get stuck, and there's a complete solution available, but I encourage you to spend real time diagnosing the problems yourself before looking at either. These kinds of configuration issues are incredibly common in real Kubernetes deployments. Someone creates a ConfigMap in the default namespace when the Pod expects it elsewhere. Someone specifies a StorageClass that doesn't exist in the cluster. Someone uses plaintext in a Secret's data field when it should be base64 encoded. Practicing with these scenarios now will make you much more effective when you encounter similar issues in production.

When you've successfully fixed all the problems and the application is running, you'll be able to access it through your browser and see it displaying its configuration. That's your success criteria. And when you're done, there's a cleanup section that shows you how to remove all the objects you created, including the custom namespace and any resources that might have been created in other namespaces. Proper cleanup is always important when you're working through lab exercises.

This lab builds directly on the troubleshooting skills we've developed, but it adds the complexity of multiple resources and the relationships between them. Take your time, be systematic, and use the diagnostic tools we've learned. Let's get started with troubleshooting this multi-resource application!
