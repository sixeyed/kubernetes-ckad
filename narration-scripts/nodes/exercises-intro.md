Welcome back! Now that we've covered the fundamental concepts of nodes and how they form the foundation of your Kubernetes cluster, it's time to put that knowledge into practice with some hands-on work. This is where the theory starts to become tangible, and you'll see exactly how Kubernetes tracks and manages the compute resources that actually run your containers.

In the upcoming exercises, we're going to explore how to work with nodes using kubectl, starting with the basics of querying node information. You'll use the get and describe commands to see what Kubernetes knows about the machines in your cluster, from their capacity and available resources to their current workload and health status. This is the foundation of understanding your cluster's compute layer, and you'll find yourself using these commands constantly as you work with Kubernetes.

We'll then dive deeper into working with kubectl itself, exploring the built-in help system that makes it easier to discover commands and options without constantly referring to external documentation. You'll learn how to use kubectl explain to understand resource types, and you'll get comfortable with the command structure that you'll be using throughout your Kubernetes journey. The kubectl tool is your primary interface to the cluster, so becoming fluent with it early on will pay dividends in everything you do with Kubernetes.

The exercises will also cover querying and formatting, which is where kubectl really shows its power. You'll learn how to output node information in different formats like JSON and YAML, and you'll explore JSONPath queries that let you extract specific fields from the output. This is particularly valuable for automation and scripting, but it's also incredibly useful when you just need to quickly check a specific piece of information without wading through pages of output. You'll see how to query things like CPU capacity, memory availability, and container runtime versions with precision.

Finally, there's a lab challenge where you'll work with node labels, which are key-value pairs that record additional information about your nodes. You'll discover the standard labels that Kubernetes platforms provide, including details about CPU architecture and operating system. This introduces you to the labeling system that becomes crucial later when you need to direct workloads to specific types of nodes based on their characteristics.

Before you start the exercises, make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster running and kubectl installed and configured. A single-node cluster like Docker Desktop or Minikube works perfectly fine for these exercises, though if you have access to a multi-node cluster, you'll see even more interesting information in the output. Have a terminal ready and perhaps a text editor open for taking notes or experimenting with commands.

These node operations might seem basic at first, but they're absolutely essential for working with Kubernetes. Understanding how to query your cluster's compute resources, how to navigate kubectl's features, and how to extract exactly the information you need will serve you well throughout your CKAD preparation and beyond. When you're troubleshooting scheduling issues or planning capacity in production environments, these are exactly the skills you'll rely on. Let's get started with the hands-on exercises and see how to work with nodes in practice!
