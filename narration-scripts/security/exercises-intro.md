Welcome back! Now that we've covered fundamental Kubernetes security concepts, it's time to implement these security controls hands-on. We're going to work through comprehensive security configurations that will prepare you for both real-world deployments and the CKAD exam.

In the upcoming exercises video, you'll start by understanding security contexts at a fundamental level, seeing why the default behavior of running containers as root poses significant security risks. We'll explore both pod-level and container-level security contexts, learning when to use each and how container-level settings can override pod-level configurations for more granular control. You'll practice running containers as non-root users, which is one of the most critical security practices in Kubernetes. We'll work through configuring specific user and group IDs, ensuring your applications never run with unnecessary privileges.

Then we'll dive into working with read-only filesystems, one of the most effective ways to create immutable containers that can't be modified by attackers. You'll learn how to configure read-only root filesystems while still providing writable locations for temporary files and application data that genuinely needs to change. Next, you'll explore Linux capabilities in depth, understanding how to drop all capabilities by default and then selectively add back only the specific capabilities your application needs. This fine-grained approach to privilege management is far more secure than simply running containers as root. You'll also learn about preventing privilege escalation, ensuring that processes can't gain additional privileges through setuid binaries or other escalation mechanisms.

We'll look at privileged containers and understand why they're dangerous, seeing how they grant access to all host devices and should be avoided in production unless absolutely necessary. You'll work with filesystem groups to properly manage volume permissions, ensuring that multiple containers or users can access shared storage with the correct ownership and permissions. The exercises include a comprehensive lab challenge where you'll secure a web application by combining multiple security controls, implementing everything from non-root execution to read-only filesystems with writable cache directories and properly configured capabilities.

Throughout the exercises, you'll be following security best practices and learning the patterns that the CKAD exam expects you to know. We'll cover the critical fields and configurations that appear most frequently in exam scenarios, giving you both the practical skills and the exam-specific knowledge you need.

Before starting the exercises video, make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster, kubectl installed and configured, and a terminal with a text editor ready. The exercises demonstrate security patterns that protect applications in production environments while maintaining functionality. Security is core to the CKAD exam, and you'll be expected to configure security contexts, work with capabilities, and implement defense-in-depth patterns without breaking your applications. Beyond the exam, these security controls are fundamental to running production workloads safely. Every application needs proper security boundaries, and understanding these patterns helps you deploy secure, compliant applications that can withstand real-world threats. Let's get started with the hands-on exercises!
